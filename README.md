What first started as a simple website to present my Heavy Metal band has now evolved into my very own Fullstack learning course. Throughout my first commits you may see some more or less clean code and many approaches you disagree with, but you'll notice that throughout time I've been constantly improving every aspect of this app, implementing new features, even those considered unnecessary for such a website, as my goal is to improve in all areas.
